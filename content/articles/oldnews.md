## Russia
According to one survey, 59 percent of Russians aged 18 to 35 believe that “to attain success in life, you sometimes have to go against your moral principles and standards,” reports the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta.
## Peru
Some of the oldest corncobs ever found suggest that the inhabitants of northern Peru were making popcorn and corn flour at least 3,000 years ago.

## Italy
Lucio Soravito De Franceschi, the Catholic bishop of Adria-Rovigo, believes that a religious message ought to favor having “direct contact with individuals” where they live. “Our pastoral care should go from ringing church bells to ringing doorbells,” he says.

## South Africa
The street value of rhinoceros horn for medical use has risen to as high as $65,000 (U.S.) per kilogram (2.2 lb). In 2011, in South Africa alone, a record 448 rhinos were slaughtered by poachers. Museums and auction rooms in Europe have been broken into by gangs seeking the horns. Even rhinos in European zoos are thought to be at risk.

## United States
During the week of October 29, 2012, New York City experienced a dramatic decline in murders, felony assaults, and robberies compared with the same five-day period in 2011. The reason? Hurricane Sandy, a fierce storm that ravaged the East Coast of the United States, causing massive power outages. “After a natural disaster or large-scale catastrophe like [the terrorist attack that occurred on September 11, 2001], we see conventional crime come down,” said New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne. There was, however, an increase in burglaries because of looting, which did not surprise Browne. “There are a lot of unlit areas,” he said.
