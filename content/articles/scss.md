## What is SASS?

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS pre-processor that lets you use variables, mathematical operations, mixins, loops, functions, imports, and other interesting functionalities that make writing CSS much more powerful. In some ways, you may think of SASS as a style sheet extension language because it extends the standard CSS characteristics by introducing the benefits of a basic programming language. So SASS will compile your code and generate the CSS output a browser can understand.
Yes, you just read "programming language" but it really is basic stuff. If you are a programmer, it will only take you 15 minutes to get SASS. But if you have no experience coding, then your learning curve will be a little higher. Once you learn CSS with SASS, you won't write CSS from scratch anymore.

## Important features about SASS and SCSS.

If you know CSS, you know SASS. SASS comes with two different syntaxes: SASS itself and SCSS, the most used one. SCSS syntax is CSS compatible, so you just have to rename your .css file to .scss et voilà! Your first SCSS file has been created, just like that.
Of course, by doing this you are not using any of the superpowers and abilities SASS provides, but at least you realize you don't need to spend hours and hours to start using SASS. From this starting point, you would be able to learn the SASS syntax as you go.

## Variables for whatever you want.

One of the great benefits of using a CSS pre-processor like SASS is the ability to use variables. A variable allows you to store a value or a set of values, and to reuse these variables throughout your SASS files as many times you want and wherever you want. Easy, powerful, and useful.
