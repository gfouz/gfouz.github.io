## There is just so much to write about me. Where do I start?

I  have been working on cutting metal machine tools for than 25 years.
But  this  is  not  very  meaningful  at   this moment at all, because
programming languages is about a different thing. I began learning C++
in 2017 in order to write firmwares for micro-controllers and this was
my  first  touch  with this wonderful world. But in time, reading some
books  i  discovered  new  and important things, i refer to Html, Css,
JavaScript  its  frameworks  and  node  js.  On  that  time I was very
interested  on learning Angular but i found a better option for me and
i  talk  about  React  Js that drew all my attention for some time and
after this, a friend of mine suggested me to take look at Vue Js and I
did  it. And i really love this technology because i consider it to be
a great idea.
