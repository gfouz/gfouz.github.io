## What is Nuxt JS?

According to their official page:

“Nuxt  is a progressive framework based on Vue.js to create modern web
applications.   It   is  based  on  Vue.js  official  libraries  (vue,
vue-router  and  vuex)  and powerful development tools (webpack, Babel
and  PostCSS).  Nuxt’s  goal  is  to make web development powerful and
performant  with great developer experience in mind.” It allows you to
create  three  types  of  applications,  depending on the purpose it’s
intended for:

## Why Nuxt is good choice?

Web   developers  build  a  lot  of  Single  Page  Applications  using
JavaScript frameworks (Angular, React, Vue). SPAs dynamically populate
the  contents  of  their  pages on load which means by the time google
crawls  their  site,  the important content is yet to be injected into
the  site.  Part  of  this problem can be solved by pre-rendering your
application’s content. This is where server-side applications come in,
and  for Vuejs developers, we can build server-side applications using
Nuxt.js.

## Three important purposes in mind.

**Single page application**

Most  JavaScript  frameworks  (React,  Angular, Emberjs, Vue, etc) are
single  page application whose contents are dynamically populated with
faster transitions. Most SPAs make use of the HTML5 history API or the
location Hash for routing.

**Server  Side  Rendered Applications  (SSR)**  

Server-Side  Rendering  is  a  technique  used  to  fetch  and display
client-side  data  on  the server to send a fully rendered page to the
client. This is a good approach to get good SEO for your application.

**Static Generated pages (Pre-rendering)**

Static generated applications do not require API requests to fetch the
contents  of  the pages, i.e. the contents are already included in the
HTML  file.  An  example  of a static site is a portfolio website or a
landing page for a product.
