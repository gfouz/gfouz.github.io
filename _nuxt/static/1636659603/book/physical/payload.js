It is now recommended that to maintain a maximal level of cardiovascular health, you should accumulate up to 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Again, this can be achieved by engaging in several brief sessions spread throughout the day. The journal Canadian Family Physician explains that “current recommendations call for an accumulation of up to 60 minutes of activity on a given day. For some health benefits, it does not appear to matter how the minutes of activity are accumulated.” This medical journal also states: “While several studies have documented that vigorous activity is associated with lower all-cause mortality, current emphasis is on promoting moderate activity.”"}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:i,props:{id:g},children:[{type:a,tag:j,props:{ariaHidden:k,href:"#make-the-time-to-remain-active",tabIndex:l},children:[{type:a,tag:m,props:{className:[n,o]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:h}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:p,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"The bottom line is that your body is designed to move around and engage in regular physical activity. A sedentary life-style is harmful to your health. And there is no vitamin, medicine, food, or surgical procedure that can replace your need to remain active. Also, we must all face the fact that an adequate exercise routine, whether moderate or vigorous, whether done in short installments or longer sessions, requires time. Just as you make the time for eating and sleeping, it is vital that you also make the time to remain physically active. This involves self-discipline and good personal organization.\r\nThere is no hassle-free exercise program. However, the inconveniences and sacrifices involved in maintaining an active life-style pale into insignificance when compared with the life-threatening dangers of an inactive life-style. Stay active, break a sweat now and again, work those muscles—you might live a healthier and longer life!"}]}]},dir:"\u002Farticles",path:"\u002Farticles\u002Fphysical",extension:".md",createdAt:q,updatedAt:q},prev:{slug:"personal-experience",title:"MY EXPIRIENCE..."},next:{slug:"responsive",title:"RESPONSIVE DESIGN!"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("element","text","\n","vigorous-activities-have-benefits",2,"Vigorous activities have benefits.","make-the-time-to-remain-active","Make the time to remain active.","h2","a","true",-1,"span","icon","icon-link","p","2021-11-11T15:56:51.227Z")));
