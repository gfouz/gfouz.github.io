But if you are not a designer, you may be wondering what this term means. You might also be unsure as to whether or not business’s website should be implementing responsive design, especially if you do not understand the concept.\r\nResponsive design can help you solve a lot of problems for your website. It will make your site mobile-friendly, improve the way it looks on devices with both large and small screens, and increase the amount of time that visitors spend on your site. It can also help you improve your rankings in search engines."}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:j,props:{id:h},children:[{type:a,tag:k,props:{ariaHidden:l,href:"#what-is-responsive-design",tabIndex:m},children:[{type:a,tag:n,props:{className:[o,p]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:i}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:q,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"First, here’s a quick explanation of responsive design and how it works. Essentially, responsive design is a way to put together a website so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size on which it is viewed. It keeps images from being larger than the screen width, and prevents visitors on mobile devices from needing to do extra work to read your content.\r\nThe ultimate goal of responsive design is to avoid the unnecessary resizing, scrolling, zooming, or panning that occurs with sites that have not been optimized for different devices. It is often very difficult to navigate these sites, and it may even cost you potential customers who become frustrated with trying to figure out how to do something."}]}]},dir:"\u002Farticles",path:"\u002Farticles\u002Fresponsive",extension:".md",createdAt:r,updatedAt:r},prev:{slug:"physical",title:"PHYSICAL ACTIVITY!"},next:{slug:"scss",title:"THANKS SASS!"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("element","text","\n","responsive","why-is-responsive-design-so-important",2,"Why is Responsive Design So Important?","what-is-responsive-design","What is responsive design?","h2","a","true",-1,"span","icon","icon-link","p","2021-11-11T15:56:51.227Z")));
