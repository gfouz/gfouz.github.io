In some ways, you may think of SASS as a style sheet extension language because it extends the standard CSS characteristics by introducing the benefits of a basic programming language. So SASS will compile your code and generate the CSS output a browser can understand.\r\nYes, you just read \"programming language\" but it really is basic stuff. If you are a programmer, it will only take you 15 minutes to get SASS. But if you have no experience coding, then your learning curve will be a little higher. Once you learn CSS with SASS, you won't write CSS from scratch anymore."}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:e,props:{id:o},children:[{type:a,tag:f,props:{ariaHidden:g,href:"#important-features-about-sass-and-scss",tabIndex:h},children:[{type:a,tag:i,props:{className:[j,k]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:p}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:l,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"If you know CSS, you know SASS.

Your first SCSS file has been created, just like that.\r\nOf course, by doing this you are not using any of the superpowers and abilities SASS provides, but at least you realize you don't need to spend hours and hours to start using SASS.
