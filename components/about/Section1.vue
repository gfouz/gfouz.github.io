        <h3>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>
            I began learning C plus plus in 2017 in order to write firmwares for
            micro-controllers. I was studying this language for more than a year
            but eventually i heard talk about Node js and the wonder that it is,
            and from that time on i haven't quit learning because these things
            are my world. Things such as React and Express JS have drawn
            all my attention so that i have studied these technologies. But more
            recently i discovered one of the best and modern tools that is used to
            create wed applications and i refer to Vue JS and its ecosystem which
            i am focused on right now.
